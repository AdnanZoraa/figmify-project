# Figmify: From Wireframe to Prototype

## About the Project
The Figmify project introduces the fundamentals of wireframing and demonstrates how to convert wireframes into functional prototypes before starting coding.  
The main goal is to improve user experience and resolve usability challenges early in the design process.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:  
- Understand the critical role of wireframing in the product design lifecycle.  
- Differentiate between Low-Fidelity (Low-Fi) and High-Fidelity (High-Fi) wireframes and know when to use each.  
- Explore wireframing tools such as Figma for creating interactive and effective prototypes.  
- Analyze and document the benefits of wireframing to improve communication and reduce risks.  
- Gain practical experience through real-world examples where wireframing solved usability challenges.

## Project Requirements
- Working knowledge of GitHub for project management and documentation.  
- Familiarity with UI/UX concepts: layout design, navigation, and prototyping.  
- Access to Figma or other wireframing tools.  
- Ability to use Markdown to create well-organized documentation.
